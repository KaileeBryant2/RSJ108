Make your own step-by-step guide
================================

This template allows you to build a more advanced step-by-step guide.
The example theme here is for you to change as much as you like to
create appearance and content which are truly your own.

READ THROUGH THE COMMENTS. This is a comment. Everything inside of
this for HTML or '/*' for CSS, is not processed as code, but
instead are just text comments about the code. For this project, the
comments will give you instructions, hints and guides to completing
the project, so skim down through the comments to get an understanding
of what you are being asked to do.

GET ORIENTED IN THE CODE. HTML is made up of tags that look like
this <p> </p>. The tags tell you something about the information
contained between them. Click on the tags in the code on this side
of the editor to get a description of what each tag is for.

IN THIS CHALLENGE, YOU WILL LEARN ABOUT:

- HTML: Nested lists
- HTML: Unordered list
- HTML: Captions
- CSS: Borders
- CSS: Embedding images and videos

            <div class="content">
              <h3>Start with an open-ended question. An open-ended question cannot be answered by “yes" or "no" and it usually does not have right or wrong answers.</h3>
              <p>An open ended question is a good way to put the candidate at ease. You want your candidates to feel comfortable. And if a candidate feels comfortable that person is more likely to engage.</p> 
              <p>Open-ended questions are also a good way for you to find out some basic qualifications of the candidate, and to get some cues as to what to ask next.</p>
              <p>Try for questions like: “Tell me about the relationships you’ve had with the people you’ve worked with. How would you describe the best ones? The worst?” This question will immediately give you a good idea of well the candidate might fit on a team in your workplace. Candidates typically don’t like to speak badly about coworkers or bosses, especially in an interview. This question lets you see how this person navigates those waters.</p>


            </div>
          </li>

          <!-- A new step -->
          <li>
            <div class="content">
              <h3>Formulate questions that force your interviewee to express a knowledge of your company. You want to make sure that your interviewee did homework and learned about your company. And you should want to find out if this person just learned facts, or really understands you.</h3>
              <p>Questions that ask the candidate to visualize being in the role of an existing employee will quickly show you how well this person knows your company.</p>
              <p>You might ask “Pitch [name of your company] to me as if I were buying your product or service.” This question will immediately show you how well this candidate knows what you do and if this person has the ability to speak with the company’s voice.</p>
              <p>Depending on the position you’re hiring for, be lenient on how well the candidate pitches your company. If you’re hiring for an internal, non sales position, all you want to know is if your candidate did the homework.</p>
              <p>You could also ask “If we were to sit down a year from now, reflecting on your year with the company, what would you like to have achieved?” A question like this will allow you to gauge how well the candidate sees the bigger picture of the work you do, and that this person has not only done the homework, but is committed to being a part of the company. A question like this will help weed out candidates who just read the job description.</p>

              <h3>Prepare to summarize a candidate’s answers and transition to the next question. Repeating what the candidate just said will give you a second to digest the information and can allow you to press this person with your next question.</h3>
              <p>You want to find out if the interviewee is actually knowledgeable on the subject at hand. For instance, if a candidate said “I managed a large system implementation project when I was with my last company.” You could repeat the answer and move on to your next question which will both follow up and get more information about how this candidate would perform in your company.</p>
              <p>After you repeat the answer (you shouldn’t just repeat it word for word, paraphrase it) you could ask “Could you tell me some of the key activities you were engaged in when you managed that project? And how do you think that experience would relate to this job?”</p>

              <h3>Write questions that allow you to obtain basic qualifications. During your interview, you’ll want to gauge how well a person’s resume translates to real life. Have a list of questions that will give you an idea of the candidate’s basic skill level for the job.</h3>
              <p>Ask the candidate to describe some basic responsibilities and functions of the job. Ask what the candidate might find challenging about the job. You want to have a list of basic questions that have a correct answer.</p> 
              <p>For example, if your candidate listed Adobe Photoshop as a skill, you may ask how long this person has been using Photoshop. Or, if you know Photoshop and know that using it is part of the job, you may ask a specific question related to using the program. You might ask “If I needed to create a banner and wanted to place a picture of someone’s body from another photo onto the banner, how would I do that?” If the candidate can clearly explain the process and use the right terms, you know this person possesses a certain skill level.</p>

              <h3>Write questions that challenge your candidates. You want to formulate questions that will allow you to see how the candidate performs under pressure and give you information on this person’s ability in the role.</h3>
              <p>You may want to ask something simple yet potentially challenging at first like “Is it better to be perfect and late, or good and on time?” The candidate’s answer will show you what kind of employee this person is. It will also show you how well the candidate knows your company, depending on your answer to the question.</p>
              <p>Ask the candidate about a time this person screwed up, and how the candidate fixed the problem. This is an old and good interview question. You’ll get to see how self-aware the candidate is and this person's problem-solving skills.</p>

              <p>The questions a candidate asks will be very valuable. These questions will show you how much this person has prepared and how this person views the role of the job.</p>
              <p>During the actual interview always make sure to thank the interviewee. Then explain your next steps and when you’ll be in touch.</p>
